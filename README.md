# Control-of-unstable-processes-with-time-delays-via-ADRC
Control of unstable processes with time delays via ADRC.
a two-degree-offreedom (2DOF) control structure is proposed for unstable time- delayed systems. Set-point tracking and
disturbance rejection are separated in this structure and ADRC is solely responsible for disturbance rejection. A method to tune the ADRC parameters using all the information of the system is proposed, and
robustness and performance of the proposed method are analyzed
